					<p> DISARIO was founded with the aim of offering an excellent and contemporary product, leaning on fair principles. The products reflect the origins of the founder, who was born in Holland to Italian parents, and wants to bring the exceptional Italian artisanal know-how to the Dutch market. Speaking the Italian language has been fundamental in creating relationships with key suppliers and workshops in Italy, such that we can offer such a well made product.
					<br>
					<br>

					The small leather goods are made in limited quantities from deadstock full grain calfskin leathers. All products are manufactured by a small production house who has worked their whole life with leather, and still works for the well known luxury brands, currently amongst which Bottega Veneta, Gucci and Cartier. The production and materials used for all Disario’s leather goods are of the exact same standard. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Likewise for the scarves, the whole product couldn’t be more ‘made in Italy’. All fibers used, from merino wool, to cashmere and silk, are completely Italian and are manufactured into scarfs by a family who has been working in the textile industry of Prato for generations.

					<br>
					<br>
					It’s been a true privilege to work with such skilled artisans, especially to be given this chance for a first project.
